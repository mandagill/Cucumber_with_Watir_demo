Feature: Search for jobs at ThoughtWorks
  As a technical professional, I want to view, research and apply for jobs at ThoughtWorks
  #These are placeholders; the steps have not yet been written.
	Scenario: View jobs in TW San Francisco
		Given I am on the ThoughtWorks Careers Page
        Then I click on the 'Jobs' link

        #will also want to test and see if this will pass if I tell it to click on static text?
